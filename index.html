    <h1> Which 4 bacteria had the highest MIC levels for Penicilin? </h1>
    <div id="chart1"></div>
    <p>Here the information is presented in a divided bar chart. The chart shows the MIC levels of Penicilin, Streptomycin, and Neomycin on 16 different bacteria. The visual encodings used in this chart are position on a common scale and length. The common scale allows the viewer to compare the lengths of the bars to each other in relation to that scale. The different bar lengths vary in terms of the bar as a whole as well as the lengths of each individual bar segment. Not only is the viewer comparing the total bar lengths to each other, but is also comparing the bar segment heights to other segments in the same bar as well as in other bars.
    </p>
    <p2>I ask the question: Which 4 bacteria had the highest MIC levels for Penicilin? I chose to use a divided bar chart because I wanted to emphasize the Penicilin MIC levels compared to the other wonder drugs. The other wonder drugs are miniscule compared to the Penicilin levels and I wanted to show that drastic size difference. A divided bar chart is better than a grouped bar chart in this case because since the other wonder drugs are so small compared to Penicilin, there would be awkward gaps between each of the 16 bacteria types, which wouldn't be as aesthetically pleasing. At least the divided bar chart stacks the data in one area to save space for 16 bacteria and their names, which makes it easier to compare the size of the bars. The width of the bars, colors, and scale were the default choice. I decided to stick with these choices because I thought the data display scaled well to fill the size of a typical computer screen. The colors were also different enough that they could be easily distinguished. Part of the default layout was to slant the names of the bacteria on the X axis. I think this helps with readability, especially with so many different types of bacteria. The scale increases by 200 because this shows how high of an MIC level Penicilin has in relation to the other wonder drugs. I wanted the viewer to be able to automatically spot the 4 highest Penicilin levels based on the length of the bars.</p2>
    <h1> Are the majority of the bacteria gram stains positive or negative? </h1>
    <div id="chart2"></div>
    <p>Here the information is presented in a pie chart. The chart shows the number of bacteria that had positive and negative gram stains. The visual encodings used in this chart are the perception of angle, area, and length. In terms of angle, by dividing a circle into segments makes the viewer equate the circle to being 100% and to think in a 0-100% scale. Depending on the angle will make the viewer associate either more or less area to the segment to determine that segmentâ€™s influence in relation to the other segments. The length of the arcs can also be a factor.</p>
    <p2>I ask the question: Are the majority of the bacteria gram stains positive or negative? I chose to use a pie chart because the term "majority" does not necessarily indicate having to know the exact measurement but to identify the general size of something. Pie charts are not ideal for exact measurements because viewers can often mismeasure segment sizes, especially if they are similar in size. However, since there are only two categories to compare and that a majority has to be identified, I figured a pie chart was most appropriate. The viewer is able to associate color and size with the answer to the question. From the legend, blue is negative and orange is positive, and the majority (meaning over half) is easily identified to be the negative gram stains based on the size of the blue segment in relation to the orange segment. The colors were a default choice and I decided to stick with this because I felt the colors were distringuishable enough. A warm color and a cold color are on opposite sides of the color spectrum which would make it harder to confuse the two colors. The percentages in the center of each colored segment was another default option. I decided to stick with this because even though the segment distribution may make a majority obvious, it would also be helpful to the viewer to show just by how much that the negatives are greater than the positive gram stains.</p2>
    <h1> What bacteria have a higher Streptomycin MIC than Neomycin?</h1>
    <div id="chart3"></div>
    <p>Here the information is presented in a scatter plot. The chart compares the MIC levels of Streptomycin and Neomycin on the 16 different bacteria. The visual encodings used in this chart are position along a common scale and direction. By having the data on a common scale, this allows the viewer to compare the data points evenly to one another. Direction also plays a role by the viewer being able to identify a general direction or trend the data points tend to move in. Viewers can also draw an imaginary line that follows the general direction of the data.</p>
    <p2>I ask the question: What bacteria have a higher Streptomycin MIC than Neomycin? I chose to use a scatter plot because by identifying the trends of the two wonder drugs, the viewer is able to see when the Streptomycin marker is higher than the Neomycin marker. Either by imagining lines connecting the markers or by identifying when the Streptomycin marker is above the Neomycin marker, the markers make it easy to identify position. Bar charts are relient on a common scale where the viewer must compare the position to the scale in order to determine the exact measurement. Here the markers don't rely on measurement but position and the viewer only has to pay attention to a Streptomycin marker being higher than a Neomycin marker. I decided to customize my colors and I chose pink and green. I chose these colors because I felt that they contrasted with one another. I also made the marker sizes on the smaller side (size 7). This design choice allows the viewer to clearly see when one marker is above another, along with being more accurate position-wise when compared to the MIC scale. Smaller markers make it easier to pinpoint where on the MIC scale the marker is. If the markers were larger, it would make it more difficult to identify the center of the marker to use the MIC scale. Larger markers would also make it harder to identify by how much a Streptomycin marker is higher than a Neomycin one. For example, if the viewer looks at the bacteria Brucella abortus, the distance seems more apparent than if the marker size was size 20. The markers take up more area which makes the gap nonexistent. The scale was also a default and I decided to stick with it because I thought the chart spanning across the screen was aesthetically pleasing, especially considering making room for 16 bacteria types. The default option to also slant the bacteria names was kept because they made effective use of the space to clearly display each bacteria name without looking cluttered. </p2>
